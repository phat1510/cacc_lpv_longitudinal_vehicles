## Abstract
This project studies the applications of Cooperative Control of multivehicle systems in the view of Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) approach to improve the performance of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems. In Cooperative Control, a consensus-based control framework is adopted to interactively drive the vehicles toward a common state of information using the vehicle-to-vehicle communication topologies. The string stability condition of the controlled vehicle platoon is considered. On the other hand, the variation of parameters in the vehicles dynamics exists due to the longitudinal velocity, load, road condition, engine dynamics necessitates a robust control approach. In this case, the LPV modeling is able to tackle this issue since the design controller is parameterized as a function of scheduling parameters and flexibly adapted to a specific operating instance.
